Hi Buck,

A quick question, if you know the answer off-hand.  We're considering issuing our Tropical Cyclone Discussions with mixed case letters.  (NOT EVERYONE LOVES ALL CAPS!) We use the ATCF to compose the TCD, which then sends it over to AWIPS for dissemination.  The ATCF automatically converts the text to all caps, even if the hurricane forecaster types in mixed case.  Would you know if it's an easy adjustment to allow mixed case, or is this a quite substantial project?  (Mike Brennan is likely to address it here, but hasn't scoped it out yet.)

Best regards,
chris

"Improve visibility of lat/lon within rebest dialog box. [JTWC] {NRL} 
Dialog box is already full, but perhaps you could add the BT lat lon in the table at the bottom of the dialog in lieu of central pressure and Obj Track Intensity (pending OK from NHC).

01/09/2014 email from Mike Brennan  ---    
We have at least a couple people who have already chimed in that they use the central pressure information there.  Is there another way we can squeeze the lat/lon in?  Can we get rid of the ""kts"" for the intensity column?  What about losing the first two digits of the year in the DTG?
